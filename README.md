# Code-in-cpp
This repostitory is made to contain basic DSA Code that forms the basics of programming and moving towards more complex coding problems

I'm going to use Ubuntu (Linux) for this!


###

# Downloading the packages that are required for C++ in Linux environment
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gcc g++ clang make gdb valgrind graphviz imagemagick git zip unzip

> # Running using terminal/ shell script
> ## To compile type `g++ -c cppfile_to_compile.cpp`
> It will create the object file with extention.o
> To make an executable file type `g++ -o executablefilename objectfile.o`
> To run the object file type `./executablefilename`
    For example 
        g++ -c hello-world.cpp 
        g++ -o hello-world hello-world.cpp 
        ./hello-world
